# CFCSS pintool #

This tool uses [IntelÂ®
Pin](http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/pin-a-dynamic-binary-instrumentation-tool)
to inject control-flow faults that [CFCSS](https://github.com/hermannloose/cfcss) is
designed to detect.

The scope of the tool is limited to the types of faults presented for
evaluation of CFCSS in the [original
paper](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=994926) under *IV.
Simulation Resuls*.
